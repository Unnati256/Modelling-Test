# Buidling a Classification Model
Given a dataset of a loan-lending company, the goal is to prepare a model that can predict the loan outcome at the time of application.

## Data Provided

Brief descriptions of the data are below and details of the fields are later in this document.
  1. Train Data: This contains details of the loan provided by the company.
  2. Accounts Data: Details of loans taken by the borrower before they applied for a loan from the company. These details were collected when the borrower applied for the loan.
  3. Enquiry Data: This contains details of previous loan applications made by the applicant. These applications may or may not be successful.
